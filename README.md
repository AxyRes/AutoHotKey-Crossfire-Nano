# Increase input control in crossfire zombie nano

This script automates the installation of AutoHotKey and the execution of an AutoHotKey script with administrative privileges.
This will increase the input amount when you press a control button. Better for Đào Tẩu Nano

## Usage

Run the `install.bat` script in folder `bin`

## Script Details

- The script will download the AutoHotKey installer (version 1.x) and install AutoHotKey (64-bit version) in the `AutoHotkey` folder.
- It will then run the `Duplicate_Control.ahk` script as an administrator.

## Notes


- If you encounter any issues, make sure to check for error messages displayed in the console or connect to `CI.38` in game.

## Cleanup

- The script automatically deletes the downloaded AutoHotKey installer after installation.

Feel free to customize the `install.bat` script and this `README.md` file to better suit your needs.
