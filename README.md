# AutoHotKey Installation and Script Execution Script

This script automates the installation of AutoHotKey and the execution of an AutoHotKey script with administrative privileges.

## Usage

Run the `install.bat` script:

   - Double-click `install.bat` in folder "bin" to run it.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts.

## Script Details

- The script will download the latest AutoHotKey installer and install AutoHotKey (64-bit version) in the `AutoHotkey` folder.
- It will then run the `Duplicate_Control.ahk` script as an administrator.

## Notes

- Ensure you have an internet connection for the script to download AutoHotKey.
- If you encounter any issues, make sure to check for error messages displayed in the console.

## Cleanup

- The script automatically deletes the downloaded AutoHotKey installer after installation.

Feel free to customize the `install.bat` script and this `README.md` file to better suit your needs.
